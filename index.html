		<h1>Force</h1>
		<p><font color="white">Force is a push or pull of an object to accelerate its velocity. There are different divisions of force, the main two being contact and non-contact force. Contact force being a force where two objects affect each other physically, while non-contact force is a force where an object doesn't require physical contact with another.

	<div id="Ve-">
		<h1>Valence Electrons</h1>
		<p><font color="white">Valence Electrons are the electrons found at the outermost ring. The outermost ring is also known as the Valence Shell. Valence electrons are electrons that determine an element's place in the periodic table, for example, Hydrogen, which has one valence electron in its valence shell, places the said element into its place at the first column in the periodic table.

	<div id="Momentum">
		<h1>Momentum</h1>
		<p><font color="white">Momentum is the quantity of motion. It is considered a vector quantity measured in kilograms per miles per second. Momentum is directly proportional to velocity. Its formula is made up of momentum equals to motion multiplied by velocity. (p=mv)
